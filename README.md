# Umbra
What was once the tranquil forest, became a dark, scary place overnight. A snake of horrors overtook the forest leaving everyone there in umbra. With a want to help the victims, you enter the forest. You light the lanterns that have been snuffed for so long. Possibly you gain some strengths from the solidarity of the victims, but will you defeat the ultimate enemy? Play to find out.
